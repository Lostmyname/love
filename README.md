# Love
This is a Clojure application which takes Facebook posts, performs some basic
sentiment analysis using [Alchemy](www.alchemyapi.com/) and posts the happiest
ones to Slack.

## Setup
1. Clone this project
2. Copy `profiles.clj.sample` to `profiles.clj` and fill in the blanks
3. Run `lein repl`, and get developing!

## To do
- Convert sentiment analysis from Alchemy to something like CoreNLP
- Better docs
- Tests
